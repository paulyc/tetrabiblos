Solilunar calendar based on astronomical observations. Most resembles the [Solar Hijri Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar) out of all still currently in use, but adds an additional cycle of undefined length but estimated to be somwhere around 22000-27000 solar years, based on the precession of the equinoxes, numbered starting from zero
* Precessional Cycles numbered 0-inf (still in #0)
* Years in precessional cycle numbered 0-[22000,27000]ish. Undefined length, but year 0 of precessional cycle #1, and every following cycle is defined to be the year in which the right ascension of [Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capella) is equal to zero. Since we do not know how much time has passed since the right ascension of Capella was last zero, but it happened to be very near zero on the [Mesoamerican Long Count calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar) date of ...0.0.0.0.0.0, (6 September -3113 Julian) has been arbitrarily chosen as year 0, therefore making most of 2020 the year #5132 of precessional cycle #0
* Solar year is defined to begin on the day (00:00:00.000-23:59:59.999 UTC) on which the right ascension of the sun is equal to 180/-180 in UTC, i.e., the winter solstice. Year #5133 of precessional cycle #0 begins on 21 December 2020 Gregorian or 8 Sagittarius because the solar year cycle does not change the lunar month and day of month.
* Days of Month Numbered 1-29/30 in month. Day 1 defined to be the day on which the phase of the moon = 0 (new) UTC
* Month is defined to be the canonical Western zodiacal constellation in which the Sun is located on the new moon (i.e. the "can't have two Pisces in the same year just because Pisces takes up much more of the ecliptic than Aquarius or Aries' rule) Can be represented in canonical English "Aries" or as the character for that constellation which are representable in emoji "[insert aries emoji here]"
