[see Calendar Gregorian Equivalents for 2020](https://github.com/paulyc/tetrabiblos/blob/flockleader/printable/tetrabiblos-bw.pdf)

Lunisolar calendar based solely on astronomical observations. Most resembles the [Solar Hijri 
Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar) out of all still currently in use, 
but adds an additional cycle of undefined length but estimated to be somewhere around 22000-27000 
solar years, based on the precession of the equinoxes, but unknown precisely due to random chaotic 
factors in the Earth's precession general relativity etc, therefore can only be observed and not 
calculated (as of 2020 technology anyway)  and are numbered starting from zero
* Precessional Cycles numbered in range [-inf,inf] inclusive of 0 (still in #0)
* Years in precessional cycle numbered 0-[22000,27000]ish. Undefined length, but year 0 of 
precessional cycle #1, and every following cycle is defined to be the year in which the right 
ascension of [Capella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capella) and that of the sun are both equal to 
zero, ie on the vernal equinox. Since we do not know how much time has passed since the right 
ascension of Capella was last zero, but it happened to be very near zero on the [Mesoamerican Long 
Count calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerican_Long_Count_calendar) date of 
...0.0.0.0.0.0, (6 September -3113 Julian), year #0 of cycle #0 has been arbitrarily defined to be 
the year in which the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar date was ...0.0.0.0.0.0 (Long count dates 
have an indefinite number of terms that simply roll over into the next higher significant figure in 
base-18), therefore making most of 2020 the year #5132 of precessional cycle #0
* Solar year is defined to begin on the day (00:00:00.000-23:59:59.999 UTC) on which the right 
ascension of the sun is equal to 180/-180 in UTC, i.e., the winter solstice. Year #5133 of 
precessional cycle #0 begins on 21 December 2020 Gregorian or 8 Sagittarius because the solar year 
cycle does not change the lunar month and day of month.
* Days of Month Numbered 1-29/30 in month. Day 1 defined to be the day on which the phase of the 
moon = 0 (new) UTC. Whether each month is 29 or 30 days is completely random and can only be 
calculated or observed, but months can only be 29 or 30 days, at least until the moon's orbit has 
significantly decayed, which should be at least several whole precessional cycles away...
* Name of Month is defined to be the canonical Western zodiacal constellation in which the Sun is 
located on the new moon (i.e. the "can't have two Pisces in the same year just because Pisces takes 
up much more of the ecliptic than Aquarius or Aries' rule) Can be represented in canonical English 
"Aries" or as the character for that constellation which are representable in emoji "[insert aries 
emoji here]"
* Given all of the proceeding, 8 June 2020 Gregorian is equal to 18 Taurus of year 5132 of 
precessional cycle 0, representable by any of 0.5132, 0;5132, 5132.0, or 5132;0 based on yet to be 
determined convention, and given that, any preceeding or following date (notwithstanding the 
precessional cycle, which can only be determined by counting cycles, or the exact year in the 
precessional cycle when RA(Capella) is near zero on the vernal equinox) can be calculated from the 
relative positions of the moon, the sun, and Capella
* In theory dates before the epoch of year 0 cycle 0 are represented by negative year number and 
negative precessional cycle number, but the calculation of dates in year or precessional cycle -1 
or any previous cycles has not yet been performed in practice
